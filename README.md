# FAQ Accordion

This Project is to show my understanding of react and how to make it interactive. 

## How does it work 

Well  you might have seen faq accordions, and it's like that. You clicked the + button on the side of the question and a explanation will
ease in below the question. The button will turn from + to - and there can only be one answer that shows. 
If you want the answer to another question, the current question with the answer out will automatically be close and the other one will show.

That's the end of the explanation for this project

### Note

This is my first time writing a README.md on a project and would like feedback on how to better structure my readme. Thank you.
